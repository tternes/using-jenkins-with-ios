# Using Jenkins with iOS Projects

This talk was given at the [Iowa Mobile Developers][iowamobiledevs] meetup as a quick-start guide to using Jenkins. The talk focused on the needs of the moonlighting iOS developer. It quickly covered:

* A few reasons you should consider Jenkins, even on solo projects
* Setting up a local Jenkins installation
* Running Xcode builds
* Pushing builds to TestFlight
